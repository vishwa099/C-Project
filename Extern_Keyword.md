The extern keyword is used when we have to tell the compiler that our used varibale in various scopes
must be defined later on elsewhere in the program. 

This keyword is used when several persons working on different files and on the same project and
want to use the varibales of different programmer's files.

like we have to acces the varibale p in file2 that is declared in the file2.

so, here comes the role of extern keyword.
(This is not teached in btech.)
